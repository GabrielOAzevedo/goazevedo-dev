# Goazevedo.dev

This is the repository for my personal portifolio, you may be asking: why is it public? Well... The main reason is that as being public, other devs can see the code and learn how to create something similar, but it is nothing spetacular.

## Installation

Just clone, npm install, npm run dev and use, no dependencies needed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielOAzevedo/rginx.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Just edit the files if you want, otherwise you can impersonate being me.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

(Your time would be better used elsewhere though)

## License
There is no license for the code, however, my personal info is mine so... Please, use your own information for the portifolio.
